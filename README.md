Python Facebook Bot

A basic python facebook-bot that can automate birthday wishes to people/friends via crawling through one's facebook birthday event page.
All you need to do is: enter your username and password with a message (right now it's inside the code, can be made user-input as well.)

Requirements:
Python 3.x, Selenium, Chrome Driver (we can use other drivers to run on other browsers as well.)

In future, i would like to like create methods that can be invoked to do following stuffs:
1. Like status update of a particular id(person)
2. Spam in comments and groups
3. post status automatically on a desired time intervals.
